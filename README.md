This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What is this?

Just a simple website that I made, with the help of [Emilien](https://edgie.emilien.ca/), to teach myself how use Next.js and React.js

## If you want to use this for some reason

You can start by running the dev sever like this:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site.

## Deployment

HA, haven't gotten that far, figure it out for yourself.
